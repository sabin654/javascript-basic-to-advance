// Sure, let's break down each of these expressions in JavaScript:

// == (Equality Operator):

// This operator checks for equality, but it performs type coercion. It converts the operands to the same type before comparing them.
// For example:
// 1 == '1' returns true because JavaScript coerces the string '1' to a number before comparison.
// === (Identity Operator):

// This operator checks for equality without performing type coercion. It compares both the value and the type.
// For example:
// 1 === '1' returns false because the types of the operands are different.
// null > 0:

// In JavaScript, null is considered to be of type object. When compared with a number, it is coerced to 0.
// So, null > 0 becomes 0 > 0, which evaluates to false.
// null < 0:

// Similar to the previous case, null is coerced to 0. Therefore, null < 0 becomes 0 < 0, which also evaluates to false.
// null == 0:

// This comparison is a bit tricky. In JavaScript, when you use the == operator, type coercion occurs.
// However, null is only equal to undefined or itself when using ==. It's not equal to any other value.
// Therefore, null == 0 returns false.
// Let's summarize the results:

// == and === return false for null == 0 and null === 0 because null is only loosely equal to undefined or itself.
// null > 0 and null < 0 both return false because null is coerced to 0 when compared with a number.

// Let's consider the comparisons involving undefined:

// null > undefined:

// In JavaScript, both null and undefined are coerced to NaN when compared with numerical values.
// So, null > undefined evaluates to false.
// null < undefined:

// Similar to the previous case, both null and undefined are coerced to NaN, resulting in null < undefined also evaluating to false.
// null == undefined:

// When using the == operator, null and undefined are loosely equal.
// Therefore, null == undefined returns true.
// In summary:

// null and undefined both coerce to NaN when compared with numerical values.
// null == undefined evaluates to true because they are loosely equal according to JavaScript's type coercion rules.
